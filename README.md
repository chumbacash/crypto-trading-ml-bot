## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chumbacash/crypto-ml-trading-bot.git
    cd crypto-trading-ml-bot
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Files

- `data/data.csv`: The historical cryptocurrency data file.
- `models/lstm_model.h5`: The pre-trained LSTM model.
- `scripts/train_model.py`: Script to train the model.
- `scripts/backtest.py`: Script to backtest the trading strategy.
- `scripts/live_trading_bot.py`: Script for live trading (optional).

### Training the Model

To train the model, run the `train_model.py` script. Ensure you have the historical data in the `data` folder.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Backtesting the Model

To backtest the model, run the `backtest.py` script. This will simulate trading on historical data and output the performance metrics.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```


### Live Trading
For live trading, you can use the `live_trading_bot.py` script (optional). Note that this script is a template and will need to be customized with your trading platform API details.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
